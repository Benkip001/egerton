    <h2>CHALLANGES</h2>
    <P>The major challenge i have experienced during my time in Egerton is the issue of <em>strikes</em> of both stuedents and staff.A students strike was experienced in December 2019 after the students through the <strong>Students Union Of Egerton University (SUEU)</strong> felt that the administration was not taking their plight with consideration.As a result,studies were suspended for a while in the institution.The institution staff also went on an industrial strike after their Bargained wage agreement was not honoured.The strike lasted for 1 month until finally an agreement was reached upon.Shortly afterwards a lecturers strike followed with the dons accusing the institution of not honouring the Bargained Wage Agreement.The strike lasted for almost 4 months with a series of meetings that bore no fruits.All this time learning remained suspended and students were askej
      d to evacuate school until an agreement was agreed.The students were eventually recalled on February after an agreement occured.This makes leearning to be very inconsistent and completion of courses to take longer periods. </P>
